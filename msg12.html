      <p style="color: aliceblue;">My gorgeous Rania, <br> <br>

Before meeting you, I was a man who valued and respected women because that's how I was raised. I was taught to be a gentleman, to understand that women should be cared for and protected. A man’s strengthboth physical and mental is meant to support the women in his life, whether it’s his wife, mom, or sister. My father always told me that a man puts these three women before his own self, no matter what he’s going through. That’s how I’ve lived my life. <br> The woman is weak ,And by "weak," I don’t mean women are incapable or powerless, but in moments of challenge, the man must be the one who carries the weight. It’s my responsibility as a man to ensure their happiness and well-being.

Then I met you, Rania, and these feelings of responsibility grew even stronger. My desire to care for and protect you became a part of who I am. With you, I feel like I need to be even better, stronger, and more loving. I should take care of you, make you happy, and ensure you never feel alone or insecure. Before you, I was already someone who despised boys who cheat or disrespect women. I couldn’t stand it when I saw that behavior because I’ve always believed it’s the opposite of what being a man is. No one in my entourage has ever cheated, and do you know why? Because we are men not boys. We were raised to understand that being a man isn’t just an option; it’s a must. It’s about honor, respect, and loyalty.

For me, love isn’t divided it’s whole and complete. The girl you love is the only one not two, not three, just one. Before you, when a girl passed by, I never raised my eyes to look. Not out of fear, but out of respect. Even though many girls might not deserve that respect, I still gave it by not engaging with them. You see, that’s what makes me strong. I don’t flirt, I don’t entertain, and I don’t allow anyone to think they can have access to me. I’m unreachable to any girl because my strength lies in my self-control and the respect I hold for myself and for the one I love.

So, be sure of this, Rania: I am yours and only yours. You are one of a kind, the only one who holds my heart. Cheating on you or talking to another girl? That’s something you should erase from your mind because I am not like those boys. I know a lot of boys might say these words, but I don’t just say them I live by them. I know the weight of my words, and I know the value of the love I have for you. Maybe before meeting me, you didn’t know what a real man is, but now you’ve met one, and he belongs to you.

Rania, you are my love, my partner, and my responsibility. A real man lives for the women he loves ,his mom, and his sister. We break ourselves to rebuild them; we sacrifice to see them smile. When I’m with you or thinking about you, my needs and worries don’t matter. You matter. You are my priority, and your happiness is my goal.

So, my love, I hope you never doubt this: you are the only girl I talk to, the only girl in my heart, and the one I will always fight for. <br> I love you, and I will always stand by you.
<br>So, my love, please never doubt my love, respect, loyalty, and honor for you. When you question that, it truly hurts me deeply not because I’m angry, but because I give you my whole heart and soul, and it’s hard to feel like my intentions are being misunderstood.

<br>I understand your fears, Rania. I embrace them because they come from a place of love ,your love for me. Fears like these aren’t a bad thing; they show how much I mean to you, how much you care. But I want you to know that it’s my job, as your man, to stand by your side until those fears fade away completely. My purpose is to make you feel safe, secure, and cherished, so that you never feel the need to doubt me. Together, we’ll overcome anything, and I will prove to you every single day that your heart is in the right hands.

You are my everything, and my devotion to you is unshakable. Always remember that, my love.
