      <p style="color: aliceblue;"> &#128520; I cant stop thinking abt the way i m going to own you , slowly savoring every inch of your body . My hands would find their way to your skin , tracing every curve as i kiss you deeper,harder.l imagine starting whit your neck , my lips marking every inch of your skin , then tasting your chest , feeling your heartbeat quicken beneath my touch  i l ll bite your neck , taste your breasts , making you feel every part of me as I slowly drive you wild ,savoring the wetness of you as I move lower , reaching those soft ,inviting lips between your legs ,i l ll kiss you there whit both tenderness and an insatiable hunger , letting my tongue explore deeply , tasting you , feeling your body respong as you give yourself over to me.
        As i continue feeling you tremble , i want to hear you beg for more , knowing i m the one making you lose control , taking you to the edge again and again .when i finally slide inside you , i l ll take it slow , feeling every inch of you until i can't hold back .we l ll push deeper , harder ,feeling every moment together , bodies crashing together until we're both lost in each other completely,consumed by the dark , burning need we share .it ls everything i want , to be the one bringing you this pleasure.
