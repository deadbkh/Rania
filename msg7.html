      <p style="color: aliceblue;">I don't think you realize just how much I crave you The thought of finally being able to hold you, to feel your heartbeat against mine it drives me absolutely wild  Every time we talk it only makes me want you more and the wait feels like a beautiful kind of torture. Just know when the time finally comes, every ounce of this desire I've been holding back is going to be yours and I promise it'll be worth every moment we've waited</p>
