  I can’t help but feel completely consumed by the sight of you. Every time I look at you, it’s as if the world fades away, and all that exists is your breathtaking beauty. I’m addicted to the way you look how your eyes light up when you smile, how every curve of your body takes my breath away. There’s no part of you that doesn’t captivate me, and the more I see you, the more I crave you.
 
  Your beauty isn’t just something I notice; it’s something I feel, deep inside, like a constant pull I can't escape. It’s as if my heart beats faster with every glance, my body responds to every movement you make. I’ve never felt this way before so utterly captivated by someone, so drawn to them that I can’t think about anything else.

  Your physical beauty is my addiction. Your hair, the way it cascades perfectly, the soft touch of your skin that I can’t get enough of each detail about you is burned into my mind, and I find myself craving more of you with every passing second. I need to be near you, to see you, to touch you, to feel that warmth only you can give me.

  I feel as though I’m constantly longing for you, your presence, your touch, your beauty. It’s an endless cycle of desire, a thirst that only you can quench. You are my obsession, my muse, and I am addicted to every part of you. I want to memorize every inch of you, to hold you close, to never let go.

  Your beauty isn’t just something I see with my eyes—it’s something that burns through my soul, leaving me wanting more, needing more. I’m helpless to resist, and I don’t ever want to.

 You are my beautiful addiction, the one I can never get enough of, and I’ll always cherish how you make me feel.

  With all my love and desire,
  Abderrahmane
