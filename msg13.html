      <p style="color: aliceblue;">I promise you, my love, to be the man who holds your soul and body with the utmost love and reverence. <br>
        To be a companion who wraps you in tenderness beyond description,<br>
        embracing you gently as though you are the greatest gift life has given me.<br>
        I will always be by your side, reading every detail of you,<br>
        cherishing your spirit, and adoring your body as the miracle it is.<br>
        
        Your body is my masterpiece, and I will treat it as a lover treats his greatest treasure,<br>
        with gentleness when you seek peace,<br>
        and with passion when your desire calls for me.<br>
        I promise to cherish you like an artist cherishing their final creation,<br>
        with hands full of love and longing,<br>
        and eyes that see no beauty in the world but you.<br>
        
        Your lips? They are my paradise, where I lose myself,<br>
        each kiss igniting my longing and deepening my devotion,<br>
        offering me an eternal promise of love.<br>
        Between my breaths and yours, new worlds come alive.<br>
        Your eyes are the heavens I gaze into,<br>
        every glance capturing me, every look leaving me in awe.<br>
        
        As for your body, it is a poem carved into my soul,<br>
        your curves a divine masterpiece,<br>
        and your chest, the warmth that soothes the storms within me.<br>
        There, I find serenity, I find life itself.<br>
        Every touch from you remolds my being,<br>
        and in your embrace, I dissolve, as though you are my entire world.<br>
        
        Rania, your love is a fire that consumes me in the best way,<br>
        a passion that makes me thirst for more, crave more.<br>
        But I promise, this fire will never burn you.<br>
        Instead, it will warm you, protect you, and nurture you,<br>
        for I am a man who knows how to treat his queen.<br>
        
        You are the miracle I have awaited,<br>
        the woman unlike any other.<br>
        With you, I live a passion I once thought was only a dream,<br>
        and I feel as though I am a part of you, inseparable and eternal.<br>
        
        I promise to forever be with you and within you,<br>
        to make our love an endless poem,<br>
        to rediscover you every time as if it were the first,<br>
        to love you with the wild intensity of a lover<br>
        and the tender devotion of a man who knows your worth.<br>
        
        Now, and until the day I hold your hand at our wedding,<br>
        and even beyond, until my last breath on this earth,<br>
        I promise to remain yours.<br>
        
        Forever,<br>
        Abderrahmane
