         I want you to know from the depths of my heart that you have nothing to fear. I'm here with all of my soul, now and always. When I say I choose you, I mean it wholeheartedly no one else could ever take your place. You've filled my life with so much joy and purpose, and I truly believe our connection is something rare and beautiful. I would never want to hurt you or make you feel alone again.
        I cherish every word, every laugh, and every precious moment we share, even from afar. This love is something I hold close, something sacred, and with God as my witness, I promise you that my heart is yours in this life and the next. I'm here, completely and forever, to build something beautiful together, with honesty, loyalty, and so much love.
