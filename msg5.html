        I couldnt go back to sleep so i thought to write you a small msg I just wanted to remind you how much I care about you. I wish I could be there to hold you close, ease your pain, and take care of you like you deserve. Just remember, 1 1 m here for you, every step of the way. Take all the time you need to rest, my love. I love you more than anything. Sleep tight , beautiful</p>
