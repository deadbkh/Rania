        If I could write your name in the stars, I would, so that every soul would know who owns my heart. You are my muse, the inspiration behind every thought and dream that keeps me awake at night.
        
        I want to be your strength when you feel weak, your joy when the world seems dim, and your calm in moments of chaos. You’ve given my life meaning, and I am eternally grateful for the gift of you.</p>
