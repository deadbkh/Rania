      <h2>A Promise of Love and a Life Together</h2>
      To the Most Special Woman in My Life,

As the year draws to a close, I find myself reflecting on the countless blessings Allah has bestowed upon me. Among them, the greatest of all is you. Allah, in His infinite mercy, has brought you into my life, a woman so remarkable, so rare, that even if I lived for eternity, I know I would never find anyone like you.
<br>
Your strength, resilience, and beauty, both inside and out, are like a light that brightens my days. Your presence is a source of peace, and your soul reflects the purity and kindness that this world desperately needs. I pray to Allah to protect you from all harm, to heal the wounds in your heart, and to fill your life with endless joy and serenity.
<br>
I promise you, once I start working and take my first steps in building our life, I will marry you, Inchaa Allah. I am deeply sorry that you will have to endure the challenges of these early days with me. Beginnings are always hard, and I wish with all my heart that you could have skipped this phase, leaving the weight for me to carry alone. My only wish is to see you in peace and happiness, free from any burden. I swear to Allah that this is my responsibility as a man: to carry you and all that comes with you, to shield you from life's hardships. Once we succeed in this life, Inchaa Allah, I will give you the world, everything you have ever dreamed of will be yours.
<br>
I know, my love, that you also want to make sacrifices just as I will. But baby, please don't forget that you will make the greatest sacrifice of all: bringing our beautiful children into this world. I know how much that means and how much strength it will take, and I am so sorry again for the weight you will bear. I only wish to make everything easier for you, to take the burden off your shoulders as much as I can because you deserve nothing but peace and happiness.
<br>
This new year, my only wish is to celebrate with you, not with grand gestures or festivities but with a quiet moment to thank Allah for the gift of you. You have taught me the meaning of love, patience, and devotion. And in my heart, I carry the promise to honor you, to cherish you, and to stand by your side as we journey through life together.
<br>
May this year bring you closer to your dreams, bring comfort to your soul, and strengthen the bond we share. My duâ€™a for you is one of endless blessings: may Allah grant you the peace you seek, the happiness you deserve, and the faith that never wavers.
<br>
You are my best person, my inspiration, and the woman who holds my heart. May Allah keep you safe, always.
<br>
With all my respect and love,<br>
Abderrahmane
