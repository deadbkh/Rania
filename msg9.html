      <p style="color: aliceblue;">I want you to know how deeply I feel about us and our future together. I'm ready to give everything for you, to bend until I break, to pour every part of myself into building a life with you. I'm not just here for the good times; I'm willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to see you happy and safe, because that's how much you mean to me.l can already see the life we'll create the home we'll share, the family we'll build, and the little ones we'll raise together. I crave the day I can call myself your husband, the day I can be there as the father of our children, guiding them and giving them all the love and support they need. My heart is so set on building a future with you, to create something beautiful and lasting.l'm here for you fully and completely. This love isn't about keeping score or balancing efforts it's about giving you everything,because you deserve it, and because there's nothing more I want than to walk through life by your side, as your husband and the father of our future children. You and our dreams mean the world to me, and I can't wait to make them real, together.</p>
