        Every day spent thinking of you is a blessing I could never take for granted. From our very first conversation, I felt an unexplainable certainty within me: you are the one I want to build my life with.
        
        I know you’ve been through difficult times, and I can sense it in the gentle way you guard your heart. But I want you to know this: I am here, not to change or heal you, but to walk beside you, support you, and show you that love can be a safe haven—a source of strength.
        
        Rania, you are the light in my world, and I am endlessly grateful for you. Every moment we share, every word we exchange, brings me closer to the dream of spending my life with you. I promise to always cherish you, to stand by you, and to honor the incredible person that you are.
        
        With all my heart,
        Abderrahmane</p>
