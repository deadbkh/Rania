      <p>Rania,
        You are the fire in my veins and the gentle whisper in my quiet moments. You have awakened parts of me I didn’t know existed, filling the voids with your light. Every time I hear your voice, I feel my heart beat faster, as if it knows its rhythm is tied to you.
        
        You are not just the love of my life—you are the life in my love. I want to hold you close, not just in my arms but in my soul, where no one else can ever touch you.</p>
