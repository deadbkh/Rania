      <p style="color: aliceblue;">My Queen Rania,<br>

        I’ve been thinking deeply about everything you’ve shared with me, about your questions and worries. I want to answer you from the bottom of my heart because you are the person I want to spend my life with, and I want you to feel safe, loved, and cherished always.
        
        When you asked me why I chose you, the answer is simple but profound. From the very first moment we connected, I felt something I’ve never felt before a sense of certainty, a deep feeling that you are the one for me. It’s as if my heart and soul recognized you before I even had the chance to understand it myself.
        
        I want to marry you because of how much I love and respect you. It’s not just about your beauty or your kindness, but everything about who you are the way you treat me with respect and care, the way you make me smile even on the hardest days, and the way you bring warmth and light into my life.
        
        You are a rare and special person, Rania. You respect me in ways that make me feel seen, valued, and loved. You are friendly, lovely, and genuine, and these qualities make me fall for you more every day. You have a beautiful soul, and I admire how strong you are, even after everything you’ve been through.
        
        I know you have fears and doubts, and I understand why. But I want you to know this: I see all of you, the good and the challenging, the happy moments and the struggles. And still, I choose you. I will always choose you.
        
        You asked how I know we will be great together. I see it in how we share the same dreams, the same values, and the same vision for the future. Together, I know we will make a loving home and build a life filled with happiness, respect, and growth. You will be an amazing wife and mother, just as I will strive to be the husband and father you deserve.
        
        Most of all, I want you to know that I want to care for you and love you, just as you will care for and love me. I believe marriage is about partnership, about being there for each other through everything life brings. I’m ready for that with you.I know I’ve told you before that marriage is a risk, especially in our generation, where so many people seem to only look out for themselves. It’s easy to feel afraid of the unknown, to wonder if the person you choose to spend your life with will truly be good for you.

        But I want you to know, with all my heart, that we are different. What sets us apart is how deeply we’re willing to sacrifice for each other. We don’t just see ourselves in this relationship we see each other. That’s what makes us unique.
        
        I truly believe that this selflessness, this unwavering love and respect we share, will make our marriage not only strong but beautifully successful. You don’t need to be afraid because I’m here, and together, we will build something extraordinary a partnership rooted in love, trust, and understanding.
        
        I’ve seen so many people, both men and women, who approach marriage with selfishness, as if it’s a constant battle for control or independence. It feels like they’ve forgotten what it truly means to build a life together.

        It bothers me when I see the mindset that being independent means never relying on your partner. For me, marriage is not about who can stand alone better it’s about standing together, supporting each other through everything.

        I believe in a partnership where we lean on each other, where I can rely on you as much as you can rely on me. We’re not opponents in some fight; we’re a team, building something that lasts. That’s why I’m so confident in us, because I know we understand this.

        Our love is about unity, not separation. And that’s what makes us different from this generation’s misunderstandings about what marriage should be.

        I hope this letter brings you comfort and reassurance. You are my heart, Rania, and I am so grateful to have you in my life. Together, I know we can face anything.
        
        Forever yours,
        Abderrahmane</p>
