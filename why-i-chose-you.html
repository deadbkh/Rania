      <p style="color: aliceblue;">My Queen Rania,<br>

        I’ve been thinking deeply about everything you’ve shared with me, about your questions and worries. I want to answer you from the bottom of my heart because you are the person I want to spend my life with, and I want you to feel safe, loved, and cherished always.
        
        When you asked me why I chose you, the answer is simple but profound. From the very first moment we connected, I felt something I’ve never felt before—a sense of certainty, a deep feeling that you are the one for me. It’s as if my heart and soul recognized you before I even had the chance to understand it myself.
        
        I want to marry you because of how much I love and respect you. It’s not just about your beauty or your kindness, but everything about who you are—the way you treat me with respect and care, the way you make me smile even on the hardest days, and the way you bring warmth and light into my life.
        
        You are a rare and special person, Rania. You respect me in ways that make me feel seen, valued, and loved. You are friendly, lovely, and genuine, and these qualities make me fall for you more every day. You have a beautiful soul, and I admire how strong you are, even after everything you’ve been through.
        
        I know you have fears and doubts, and I understand why. But I want you to know this: I see all of you, the good and the challenging, the happy moments and the struggles. And still, I choose you. I will always choose you.
        
        You asked how I know we will be great together. I see it in how we share the same dreams, the same values, and the same vision for the future. Together, I know we will make a loving home and build a life filled with happiness, respect, and growth. You will be an amazing wife and mother, just as I will strive to be the husband and father you deserve.
        
        Most of all, I want you to know that I want to care for you and love you, just as you will care for and love me. I believe marriage is about partnership, about being there for each other through everything life brings. I’m ready for that with you.
        
        I hope this letter brings you comfort and reassurance. You are my heart, Rania, and I am so grateful to have you in my life. Together, I know we can face anything.
        
        Forever yours,
        Abderrahmane</p>
